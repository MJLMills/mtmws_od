Od is a program for the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer
module that simulates the Lorenz system in order to produce loop-able 
control voltage and pulse signals that display sensitivity to initial 
conditions. "Od" is Cymraeg for "odd" or "strange".

The majority of the core module code is in the 
[pyworkshopsystem](https://github.com/MJLMills/pyworkshopsystem) repo, a
reusable package for building programs for the Computer module with 
MicroPython.

A .uf2 file will be provided once features are finalized and tested and all 
packaging is complete. For now it is possible to try the module out using the 
provided main.py file (which contains the complete module code).
